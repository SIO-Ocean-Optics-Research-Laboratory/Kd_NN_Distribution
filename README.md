# Kd_NN_Distribution
---
An implementation of the neural network algorithm created originally by Cedric Jamet and co-workers for estimating the K<sub>d</sub> values at any wavelength. The model can produce K<sub>d</sub> at any wavelength (but currently recommended for the visible spectral range because no valiudation was carried out outside this range), using input R<sub>rs</sub> at five light wavelengths (443 nm, 488 nm, 531 nm, 547 nm, 667 nm) corresponding the spectral bands available on ocean color sensor MODIS. The Kd_NN software can be incorporated in the inverse reflectance LS2 model to enable estmation of the inherent optical properties of seawater. The complete development and validation of the original Kd_NN model is described in [Jamet et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1029/2012JC008076) and updated in [Loisel et al. 2018](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JC013632) and [Jorge et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112537). The presented version of Kd_NN model source code is in MATLAB file format. In this version of Kd_NN code we introduced some changes with a primary purpose to streamline the structure of the code and facilitate its application by users.

This README document provides infromation about the files within the Kd_NN_Distribution repository.

## Kd_NN.m:
Neural network model to compute the K<sub>d</sub> values at preselected output wavelength(s) for nsampl "sample" inputs of R<sub>rs</sub>(λ) and solar zenith angle, where λ is at MODIS wavelengths. Returns K<sub>d</sub>(λ). See supporting documentation for further details.

## Kd_NN_LUT.mat:
Look-up tables (LUTs) necessary to run Kd_NN.m. The structure contains three fields, each of which is necessary to run the neural network. See Kd_NN.m function documentation for further details about the .mat file.

## Kd_NN_test_run.m:
Script which tests the Kd_NN on 100 samples at various wavelengths within the input domain.

## Kd_NN_test_run.xls:
Spreadsheet containing the input and resulting output parameters obtained from the application of the Kd_NN on 100 samples at various wavelengths within the input domain. The file is the original output file generated by Kd_NN_test_run.m.
